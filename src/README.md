    - Enter a single letter as your guess (no numbers or special characters allowed).
    - If your guess is correct, the letter will replace the underscores in the word.
    - If your guess is incorrect, you will lose a life, and the number of remaining lives will be displayed.
    - Keep guessing until you either correctly guess the word or run out of lives.
